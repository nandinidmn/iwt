<p><b>The Peterhof Palace is a series of palaces and gardens located in Petergof, Saint Petersburg, Russia, commissioned by Peter the Great as a direct response to
 the Palace of Versailles by Louis XIV of France.Originally intending it in 1709 for country habitation, Peter the Great sought to expand the property as a result
of his visit to the French royal court in 1717, inspiring the nickname of "The Russian Versailles". The architect between 1714 and 1728 was Domenico Trezzini,
and the style he employed became the foundation for the Petrine Baroque style favored throughout Saint Petersburg. Also in 1714, Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond,
 likely chosen due to his previous collaborations with Versailles landscaper André Le Nôtre, designed the gardens. Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli completed an
 expansion from 1747 to 1756 for Elizabeth of Russia. The palace-ensemble along with the city center is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</b>

<p><b>Olkhon is the third-largest lake island in the world. It is by far the largest island in Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia, with an area of 730 km2. Structurally,
it constitutes the southwestern margin of the Academician Ridge. The island measures 71.5 km in length and 20.8 km in width.
There are two versions regarding the origin of the name of the island and both are derived from the language of the Buryats, the indigenous people of Olkhon.
The first is that the island's name comes from the word oyhon–“woody”, and the second is that it comes from olhan–“dry”. It is still debated which of the
 two is the actual origin of the name Olkhon as both words describe the island perfectly. Much of the island is still covered by forests and the amount of
precipitation is extremely low – about 240 mm per year.</b>
