<p><b>The Potala Palace is a dzong fortress in the city of Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, China. It was the winter palace of the Dalai Lamas from 1649
 to 1959, has been a museum since then, and has been a World Heritage Site since 1994.The palace is named after Mount Potalaka, the mythical abode of the
bodhisattva Avalokite≈õvara. The 5th Dalai Lama started its construction in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel pointed out that
 the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa.It may overlay the remains of an
earlier fortress called the White or Red Palace on the site, built by Songtsen Gampo in 637.The building measures 400 metres east-west and 350 metres
 north-south, with sloping stone walls averaging 3 metres thick, and 5 metres thick at the base, and with copper poured into the
 foundations to help proof it against earthquakes.</b>

<p><b>The Bund or Waitan is a waterfront area and a protected historical district in central Shanghai. The area centers on a section of Zhongshan Road
 within the former Shanghai International Settlement, which runs along the western bank of the Huangpu River in the eastern part of Huangpu District. The area along
 the river faces the modern skyscrapers of Lujiazui in the Pudong District. The Bund usually refers to the buildings and wharves on this section of the road,
as well as some adjacent areas. From the 1860s to the 1930s, it was the rich and powerful center of the foreign establishment in Shanghai, operating as a legally protected treaty port.

<h1 style="font-size:50px;color:#51bb43;font-family:Gabriola"><b><u>THE HONG KONG SKYLINE</u></b></h1>
<p><b>The Hong Kong Skyline is considered one of the world's most dramatic city skylines-as much a result of its having one of the highest
concentrations of skyscrapers as it is the presence of the tall hills that frame them - Hong Kong has for decades been the
bustling capital of finance and commerce in this part of the Pacific. And it's a cityscape that can be enjoyed from a number of different vantages.One of the best
 views is from Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island, where the skyscrapers frame the city's huge harbor, a special treat after nightfall. Equally stunning is the view
 from Victoria Harbour itself. Here, you can hop aboard one of Hong Kong's famous ferries and head to various points to wander and explore, such as Kowloon. Or
you can simply stay on board and enjoy the views.

<h1 style="font-size:50px;color:#51bb43;font-family:Gabriola"><b><u>THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA</u></b></h1>
<p><b>The Great Wall of China  is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China
 as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective
stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang , the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built and
maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty .Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great
 Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control
of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks,
garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
