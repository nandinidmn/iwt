<p><b>The chateaux of the Loire Valley are part of the architectural heritage of the historic towns of Amboise, Angers, Blois, Chinon, Montsoreau, Orléans, Saumur,
and Tours along the river Loire in France. They illustrate Renaissance ideals of design in France.The châteaux of the Loire Valley number over three hundred,
 ranging from practical fortified castles from the 10th century to splendid residences built half a millennium later. When the French kings began constructing
their huge châteaux in the Loire Valley, the nobility, drawn to the seat of power, followed suit, attracting the finest architects and landscape designers. The
châteaux and their surrounding gardens are cultural monuments which embody the ideals of the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Many of the châteaux were built on hilltops,
such as the Château d'Amboise, while the only one built in the riverbed is the Château de Montsoreau. Many had exquisite churches on the grounds or within the chateau.</b>

<p><b>Saint-Jean-de-Luz is a commune in the Pyrenees-Atlantiques department, southwestern France. Saint-Jean-de-Luz is part of the Basque province of Labourd
Saint-Jean-de-Luz bay is a natural harbour in the south-east of the Bay of Biscay. It is the only sheltered bay between Arcachon and Spain. Thanks to its strong sea walls or
dykes that protect the town from the full savagery of the Atlantic Ocean, it has become a favorite for bathers across the Basque Coast. Although the seaside resort is
relatively recent, the port itself is centuries old, with the most prominent point in its history being the marriage in 1660 of Louis XIV and the Spanish princess Maria Teresa.
It is known for its royal wedding connection.Nowadays, St-Jean-de-Luz depends strongly on tourism with safe clean beaches, notable high quality hotels and a seawater spa,
swimming pools, a casino, golf courses and a conference centre that is under construction. </b>

<p><b>Gascony was a province of southwestern France that succeeded the Duchy of Gascony. From the 17th century until the French Revolution, it was part of the combined Province
 of Guyenne and Gascony. The region is vaguely defined, and the distinction between Guyenne and Gascony is unclear; by some they are seen to overlap, while others consider
Gascony a part of Guyenne. Most definitions put Gascony east and south of Bordeaux.It is currently divided between the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine
and the region of Occitanie Gascony was historically inhabited by Basque-related people who appear to have spoken a language similar to Basque.
The name Gascony comes from the same root as the word Basque.From the Middle Ages until today, the Gascon language has been spoken, although
it is classified as a regional variant of the Occitan language.</b>
