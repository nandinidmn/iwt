<p><b>Tulum is the site of a pre-Columbian Mayan walled city which served as a major port for Coba, in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.
 The ruins are situated on 12-meter tall cliffs along the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula on the Caribbean Sea. Tulum was one of the last cities
 built and inhabited by the Maya; it was at its height between the 13th and 15th centuries and managed to survive about 70 years after the Spanish began occupying Mexico.
Tulum has architecture typical of Maya sites on the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula.Tulum is one of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites. Its proximity to the modern
 tourism developments along the Mexican Caribbean coastline and its short distance from Cancún and the surrounding "Riviera Maya" has made it a popular Maya tourist
 site in the Yucatan Península. </b>
