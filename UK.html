<p><b>The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as York Minster, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest of its kind
in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the third-highest office of the Church of England and is the mother church for the Diocese of York
and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter,under the Dean of York. The title "minster" is attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period
as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific title.York Minster is the second-largest Gothic cathedral of Northern Europe and clearly charts
the development of English Gothic architecture from Early English through to the Perpendicular Period. The present building was begun in about 1230 and completed
in 1472. York is the largest cathedral completed during the Gothic period of architecture, Cologne Cathedral only being completed in 1880, after being left uncompleted for 350 years. </b>

Surrey in England. It is adjacent to the private 265 hectares Home Park, which is nearer the castle. The park was, for many centuries, the private hunting ground
 of Windsor Castle and dates primarily from the mid-13th century.Historically the park covered an area many times the current size known as Windsor Forest, Windsor
Royal Park or its current name. The only royal park not managed by The Royal Parks, the park is managed and funded by the Crown Estate. Most parts
 of the park are open to the public, free of charge, from dawn to dusk, although there is a charge to enter Savill Garden.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:50px;color:#51bb43;font-family:Gabriola"><b><u>CARDIFF</u></b></h1>
<p><b>The current capital of Wales is Cardiff. Historically, Wales did not have a definite capital. In 1955, the Minister for Welsh Affairs informally proclaimed
 Cardiff to be the capital of Wales. Since 1964, Cardiff has been home to government offices for Wales, and since 1999 it has been the seat of the Senedd.
It forms a principal area, officially known as the City and County of Cardiff, and the city is the eleventh-largest in the United Kingdom.
Located in the south-east of Wales and in the Cardiff Capital Region, Cardiff is the county town of the historic county of Glamorgan and in 1974â€“1996 of South Glamorgan.
It belongs to the Eurocities network of the largest European cities. A small town until the early 19th century, its prominence as a port for coal when mining began
in the region helped its expansion. In 1905 it was ranked as a city and in 1955 proclaimed capital of Wales. Cardiff Built-up Area covers a larger area outside
the county boundary, including the towns of Dinas Powys and Penarth.</b>

 meadows of the upper Thames to an escarpment, known as the Cotswold Edge, above the Severn Valley and Evesham Vale.The area is defined by the bedrock of Jurassic
 limestone that creates a type of grassland habitat rare in the UK and that is quarried for the golden-coloured Cotswold stone.It contains unique features derived from the use of
 this stone; the predominantly rural landscape contains stone-built villages, historical towns and stately homes and gardens.</b>
