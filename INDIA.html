<p>Sanchi is a Buddhist complex, famous for its Great Stupa, on a hilltop at Sanchi Town in Raisen District of the 
State of Madhya Pradesh, India.It is located in 46 kilometres north-east of Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh.
The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India, and an important monument of Indian Architecture.
It was originally commissioned by the Mauryan emperor Ashokathe Great in the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple 
hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha. It was crowned by the 'chhatra', a parasol-like 
structure symbolising high rank, which was intended to honour and shelter the relics. The original construction work of 
this stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace 
as well as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved toranas (ornamental gateways) 
and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added. The Sanchi Stupa built during Mauryan period was made of bricks. 
The composite flourished until the 11th century.</p>

<p>The Mysuru Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and the royal residence at Mysuru in the
Indian state of Karnataka. It is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace 
is in the centre of Mysuru, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysuru is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and
there are seven palaces including this one; however, 'Mysuru Palace' or 'Amba Vilas Palace' refers specifically 
to this one within the Old fort.
The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru and is now known as the new Fort. Yaduraya built the 
first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was burnt ablaze and constructed multiple times. The old fort 
was constructed using wood and thus was the reason for the old fort to catch on fire, the current fort was made up of stone, bricks
and wood. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace was burnt down. Mysuru Palace is now 
one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than 6 million annual visitors.</p>

<h1 style=font-size:50px;font-family:gabriola;color:#51bb43><b><u>HUMAYUN'S TOMB</u></b></h1>
<p>Humayun's tomb is the tomb of the Mughal Emperor Humayun in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first 
wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum , in 1558, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son,
Sayyid Muhammad, Persian architects chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent, and is located
in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, India, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as Purana Qila , that Humayun found in 1533. 
It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such a scale. The tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993, 
and since then has undergone extensive restoration work, which is complete. Besides the main tomb enclosure of Humayun, several 
smaller monuments dot the pathway leading up to it, from the main entrance in the West, including one that even pre-dates the main 
tomb itself, by twenty years; it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri's court of the Suri 
dynasty, who fought against the Mughals, constructed in 1547 CE.</p>

 Bhagsu is also the home of 1st Gorkha Rifles. Bhagsu is named after the Bhagsunag temple currently in McLeodGanj station 
 including Bhagsu itself but also as Dharamshala, McLeodGanj and ForsythGanj.As per the Indian mythology, the snake god got into 
 a battle with King Bhagsu. The reason of the battle was that King Bhagsu had stolen water from the sacred lake called the NagDal Lake.
  King Bhagsu was defeated and eventually forgiven, and the site was consecrated as Bhagsu Nag.
 Because of the waterfall and close proximity to Mcleodganj, Dharamkot and the Triund Trek, Bhagsu has become a popular place for 
 tourists to stay. A number of hotels have been opened in Bhagsu for the increasing number of tourists.</p>
